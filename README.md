# Assassin_Game
The assassin game is simply designed and implemented using linkelist.
The players are in a kill ring where the players to play are.
There is also a graveyard list that is for the people who have been killed in the game.
The user will be prompted to enter the list of players which in this case are in "names.txt" file.
Each player has someone tracking to kill him/her and and s/he too is tracking someone.
The players are only aware of whom they are tracking but not who is tracking them.
When a player is killed the killer now tracks the person who was being tracked by the dead player s/he has killed.
The play goes on and it terminates when only one player is left in the kill ring.

In the terminal you will be displayed both the kill ring and graveyard list and who has killed who.
